
F.A.Q.
====================================

**What is Pyevole ?**

   Pyevolve is a Genetic Algorithm framework written in pure python.

**Why you have created this framework ?**

   Python is a powerful language, the features of Python glued 
   with the Genetic Algorithms can be very interesting. There
   is no good GA library written in Python today, the main effort
   of the Pyevolve is to sane this problem, since GA is a good
   method to solve optimization problems.
